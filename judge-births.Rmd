This map will attempt to plot the birthplaces of Federal Judges using the Federal Judge dataset <http://www.uscourts.gov/JudgesAndJudgeships/BiographicalDirectoryOfJudges.aspx>

```{r}
#Load Libraries






#Pull in Judge Data


#Clean Judge Data - pull out id#, birth.location, birth year


#Run mullenMisc's round_year function

#Filter judge dataset for only 1850 births

#Plot 1890 births on that map

#Plot all birth.locations on US Map. Maybe use hex or density plot.


```
